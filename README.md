## Description

This project will take use inquirer to prompt the user to add information about their team manager. After completing the 
prompts they are given the option to add an additional member that is either an engineer or intern. The user can continue 
to add information for as many team members as needed. When the user reaches the prompt to add a new member and selects
the option "Done", their information is written to an index.html file and the team data is displayed in neatly formatted cards. 

## Installation

No installation required. Use 'node index.js' to begin program.

### Usage

Respond to the prompts after the program begins. When completed 'File successfully created!' will display in the 
console and the generated file will be the repository in a folder named 'generated'. In the event that the program 
fails to write, an error is logged to the console.
